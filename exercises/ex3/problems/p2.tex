%%% QUESTION %%%

\begin{problem}{2: Linear programming problem}
  Two reactors, $R_1$ and $R_2$, produce two products A and B.
  To make 1000 kg of A, 2 hours of $R_1$ and 1 hour of $R_2$ are required. To make 1000kg of B, 1 hour of $R_1$ and 3 hours of 
  $R_2$ are reqauired. The order of $R_1$ and $R_2$ does not matter. $R_1$ and $R_2$ are available for 8 and 15 hours, respectively. 
  The selling price of A is $\frac{3}{2}$ of the selling price of B (i.e., 50\% higher). 
  We want ot maximize the total selling price of the two products. 
  
  \medskip (a) Formulate this problem as an LP in standard form. 
  
  \medskip (b) Make a contour plot and sketch the constraints.
  
  \medskip (c) Calculate the production of A and B that maximizes the total selling price. Use the simplex method, with startingpoint $x_1 = ?x_2 = 0$. 
  Is the solution at a point of intersection between the constraints? Area all contraints active.
  
  \medskip (d) Mark all iteration s on the plot made in (b), as well as the iteration number.
  
  \medskip (e) Look at the iterations on the plot and the algorithm output. Does it agree with the theory?

%%% SOLUTION %%%

\SUBTASK{a}{Standard form}

Standard form: 
\[
  \min c^{\top}x \qquad\text{s.t.}\qquad Ax = b,\ x \geq 0
.\] 

Where
\[
  c = \M{-3 & -2 & 0 & 0}^{\top},\  A = \M{2 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 3 & 0 & 1}^{\top} ,\ b = \M{8  & 15}^{\top}
.\]

\SUBTASK{c}{Solution}

The simplex algorithm gives these ouputs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $x^{(0)} = \M{0 & 0 & 8 & 15}^{\top}$
  \item $x^{(1)} = \M{4 & 0 & 0 & 11}^{\top}$
  \item $x^{(2)} = \M{1.8 & 4.4 & 0 & 0}^{\top}$
\end{itemize}

The equality constraints are active. The non-negativity constraints are not active.

\SUBTASK{e}{Theory}

I am not able to detect anything that does not follow the theory.
