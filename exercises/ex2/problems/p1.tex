\begin{problem}{Problem 1: LP and KKT conditions}
  The following linear program is in standard forM:
  \[
    \min_x c^{\top}x \qquad s.t. \qquad Ax = b,\ x\geq 0
  .\] 
  with $c\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, and $b in \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$.
  
  \medskip (a) Derive the KKT conditions
  
  \medskip (b) Show that the objective function is convex, by using the definition of a convex function.
