%%% QUESTION %%%

\begin{problem}{Problem 2: Linear programming problem}
  In a plant three products, R, S, and T are made in two process stages A and B. 
  To make a product the following time in each process stage is required: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 1 tonne of R: 3 hours in stage A plus 2 hours in stage B. 
    \item 1 tonne of S: 2 hours in stage A and 2 hours in stage B. 
    \item 1 tonne of T: 1 hour in stage A and 3 hours in stage B.
  \end{itemize}
  During one year, stage A has 7200 hours and stage B has 6000 hours available production time. 
  The rest of the time is needed for maintenance. It is required that the available production time should be fully utilized in both stages.
  
  \medskip The profit from the sale of the product is: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item R: 100 NOK per tonne.
    \item S: 75 NOK per tonne.
    \item T: 55 NOK per tonne.
  \end{itemize}
  We wish to mazimize the yearly profit.

  
  \medskip (a) Formulate this as an LP problem on standard form.
  
  \medskip (b) Which basic feasible points exist?
  
  \medskip (c) Find the solution by checking the KKT conditions at all the feasible points found in (b).
  
  \medskip (d) Formulate the dual problem for the LP in (a). 
  
  \medskip (e) Show that the optimal objective function value for the LP in (a) equals the optimal objective 
  function value for the dual problem in (d) by showing that $c^{\top}x^* = b^{\top}\lambda^*$.
  
  \medskip (f) If you can make either stage A or stage B more available, which should you choose?
