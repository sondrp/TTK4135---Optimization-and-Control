\begin{problem}{2: Infinite-Horizon Linear-Quadratic control}

Consider the discrete-time system
\[
  x_{t+1} = 3x_t + 2u_t,\ \qquad x_t \in\mathbb{R}^{1},\ u_t \in \mathbb{R}^{1}
\] 

and the cost function 
\[
  f^{\infty}(z) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \{qx_{t+1}^2 +u_t^2 \},\  q>0
.\] 

In this question, you should do calculations by hand. 

\medskip (a) SHow that the stationary Riccati equation is 
\[
  p = q + \frac{a^2pr}{r+b^2p}
.\] 

Set q = 2 and find the solution.

\medskip (b) What is the optimal feedback $u_t = -kx_t$?

\medskip (c) Is the closed loop with this controller stable?
