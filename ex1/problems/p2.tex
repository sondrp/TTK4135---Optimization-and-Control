\begin{problem}{1: KKT example 2}
Consider
\[
  \min 2x_1 + x_2 \qquad s.t. \qquad x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2 = 0
.\] 

(a) Find all points which satisfy the KKT conditions

\medskip

(b) Illustrate the gradients of the active constraint and the objective function at the KKT points.

\medskip

(c) What is the value of the Lagrange multiplier? Is this consistent with the KKT conditions?

\medskip

(d) Explain why each KKT point is (or is not) a local solution to the optimization problem.

\medskip

(e) Check the 2nd order conditions for the KKT points. 

\medskip

(f) Is this problem a convex problem?
